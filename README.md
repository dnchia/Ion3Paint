Is based in the use of the HTML5 canvas to work.

## How to use it
In web environments is necessary to use the device view (inspect in Google Chrome).
It will be changed and adapted to be a fully hybrid application. 

## References
The application was build initially following the tutorial made by Joshua Morony 
([@joshuamorony](https://github.com/joshuamorony)) in [Creating a Drawing Application in Ionic](https://www.joshmorony.com/creating-a-drawing-application-in-ionic/).

Thanks to this tutorial I learned a basic knowledge about the use of the HTML5 canvas and I finished with a very basic paint application, 
that I decided to improve and give it more functionality in order to make a useful functional application and learn in the process.
